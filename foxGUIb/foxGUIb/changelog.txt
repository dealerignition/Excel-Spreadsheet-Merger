Summary:
--------

FOX 1.6 brings to you full unicode support. see: 
  foxGUIb/test/unicode_test_japanese.rbin
This release is tested against FXRuby 1.6.0
I got some bug reports and most of them are fixed in this 
release. Please keep sending bug reports to further improve
foxGUIb.

List of changes:
----------------
* restructured the source repository to be user centered. 
  now the sources are in ./src and only the important files
  are in the toplevel directory.
* Fixed the bug that allowed to change properties of a 
  deleted widget (caused a crash)
* Fixed several bugs that led to crashes when typing 
  improper values into the property manipulators. e.g.: 
  backColor="bad input" instead of "200,255,255"
* on startup foxGUIb logs important version infos to the 
  log file. the log file is appended instead of replaced.
  in case of a problem you can send me your logfile.
* some code improvements. hope i didn't introduce more bugs
* repository switched to svn.
... the contracting design window issue (windows only) is 
  still unfixed.

===========================================================

===========================================================
foxGUIb v0.6 for FXRuby 1.4.x
===========================================================
* added widgets radiomutex menuradio and menucheck
* validates widget names (whether suitable as instance var), lowercase default names
* fixed the codegen-dialog startup bugs:
* the suggested class name changes according to the selected root widget
* codegen dialog protects settings by means of a checkboxthat toggles it readonly
* fixed bug: "on XP, the code gen window opens rather low down on the screen"
* context menu commands that are not supposed to be applied in certain situations are disabled (now foolproof ^^)
* context menu is now also available in the layout for most of the widgets (that respond to LMB-press)
* terminology: changed "paste/add under" to "paste/add inside"
* fixed: crash on closing last open layout
* fixed:  the 'ruby sequence' option for code generator was broken
* fixed: crash on generate when document has been switched meanwhile.
* newly created widget is allways highlighted blue
* terminology: changed term for foxGUIb documents from 'Dialog' to 'Layout' in the userinterface
* fixed: the copy-paste bug and removed backColor hacks that became obsolete because of the new backColor(=) singleton methods
* added cut (to the options copy, paste and delete)
* removed "place exact" by "paste under/ -before/ -after"
* event editor: can now be started from context menu
* fix: changed backColor to allways return the true color of the widget (not the blue selection color of foxGUIb).
* externalized FX.rb as libGUIb and wrote an installer for it.
* updated foxGUIb to use libGUIb14.rb
* hacked mainwindow layouts to be always in front of foxGUIb mainwin
* fixed: the mainwindow allways in front of guib hack introduced a new problem. mainwindows got generated as dialog boxes
* eliminated include FX and include Fox from libGUIb. 
* fixed bug in event_handler example


--------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.5.0 
* Compatible with FXRuby1.4.4. Unfortunately this release is incompatible with 
   old FXRuby versions <= 1.2.6. Send me a feature request if you need it.
* New feature: "EventEditor". Event handling code can be written directly in
   the EventEditor. Test running of the designed GUI with events is not included yet. 
* The code generator supports events. See the event_handler.rbin example.
* EventEditor shows documentation for each listed event in the FXRuby API
* I polished foxGUIb's own GUI a bit. Looks quite professional now ;)
* Most icons are now in TGA file format which can allways be loaded because TGA
   support is built-in in the FOX library.
* Fixed the startup crash on linux platforms.
* Fixed "Save As" Bug
Notes: Mike Parr is currently writing documentation for foxGUIb. The docu will be 
included in the package in succeding versions. Thanks to all who encouraged me to 
continue on foxGUIb!!
