foxGUIb v1.0.0 Release Notes 
============================

We have been quite stable for 2 years now and I am wondering why I did not jump to version 1.0.0 earlier. 
For this release only a few minor bugs have been fixed.

============================
foxGUIb v0.7.1 Release Notes 
============================

sorry i have dropped a big bug while refactoring that broke
load/save and copy/paste. it was subtle enought to slip
through my testing and into the release unnoticed.
(see changelog)

hope this one is stable.

foxGUIb v0.7 Release Notes 
==========================

== What is foxGUIb? ==
   foxGUIb is a GUI creator and code generator for FXRuby. It's a 
   convenient tool that makes it easy to quickly build complex and 
   good looking graphical user interfaces for Ruby.
   
== Whom is foxGUIb for? ==
   * FXRuby newbies who want to experiment with the widgets and layouts.
   * FXRuby experts who want to prototype parts of their GUI components rapidly.
   ... ok, lets say everyone who wants to create a GUI with FXRuby ;)

== What has changed? ==
   * Fixed the bug that allowed to change properties of a 
     deleted widget (caused a crash)
   * Fixed several bugs that led to crashes when typing 
     improper values into the property manipulators. e.g.: 
     backColor="bad input" instead of "200,255,255"
   * on startup foxGUIb logs important version infos to the 
     log file. the log file is appended instead of replaced.
     in case of a problem you can send me your logfile.
   * some minor convenience fixes.
