installation:

1. install libGUIb: 
   cd to libGUIb and run ruby install.rb (on linux 
   this requires superuser privileges)
2. install foxGUIb: 
   you can copy foxGUIb's directory where ever you want to.
3. you are done.


usage:

* go to the foxGUIb directory and run foxGUIb either by:
  * double-clicking on foxGUIb-win32.rbw (on windows)
  * typing ruby foxGUIb.rb (on *nix-like systems)
* to release files generated by foxGUIb you might want to 
  distribute them together with libGUIb16.rb which has been
  packed into a single file for your convenience. you can
  find libGUIb16.rb in the directory ./libGUIb/lib


trouble shooting:

sometimes foxGUIb crashes when you use it in a way that is 
different from the way i'm used to use it (hope it happens 
very rarely lately).
in case of an abnormal exit have a look at log.txt where 
all of foxGUIb's output is redirected to.
please send me a bug report to meinrad.recheis@gmail.com
